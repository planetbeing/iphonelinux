Using build-toolchain
--------------------------

This script will build the GNU ARM toolchain from scratch. It must be ran as root
due to the fact that it installs the bins in /usr/local.

It will use /tmp/ipl-toolchain for temporary storage. If you would like to override
this path you can set the environment variable $TOOLCHAIN_PATH to the location of 
your temporary storage directory.

It's important to note that the files are not cleaned up after the install. You will
have to run clean for it to cleanup the packages/src directories.

The commands are as follows:

## Make toolchain
./build-toolchain.sh make
## Clean toolchain
./build-toolchain.sh clean

Logs are stored in $TOOLCHAIN_PATH/build.log ( by default /tmp/ipl-toolchain/build.log )
